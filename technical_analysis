Trend Lines 
 - Join all lows in uptrend 
 - join al peaks in downtrend 
 - if we get 2 points, we can join with a trend line & if we get 3rd point it is confirmation of the trend 
 - trendline tells where the retracement should stop 
 - retracement = price comes down upto trendline and goes up 
 - breakthrough = price crosses a trendline. this starts a new trend. it could be up or down trend 
 - if prices are above trendline, focus on buy 
 - if prices are below trendline, focus on sell 
 - use log scale settings to draw trendline 
 - points should not be too far or two close 
 - can ignore spikes to draw clear trendline 
 - always draw internal trendlines to get trading signals 
 - In an uptrend, sentiments are bullish, and we should draw a line where prices take support and demand is high
 - In logarithmic scale, the difference between two price points is spaced according to the percent change, rather than the absolute change

Stages of Stock Market 
 - Stage 1 (consolidation phase) 
 - Stage 2 (uptrend phase)
 - Stage 3 (consolidation phase)
 - Stage 4 (downtrend phase) 
 - Stage 4 (downtrend) -> Stage 1 (accumulation = sideways) -> Stage 2(uptrend) -> Stage 3(distribution = side/slight down or accumulation  = sideways/slight up) -> Stage 4 (downtrend) -> Stage 1 (accumulation) 
 - accumulation stage -> uptrend stage -> excess phase (very volatile) -> exhaustion phase -> consolidation phase 
 - there would be a gap after excess phase 
 
Gap Theory 
 - upgap & downgap 
 - common gaps (in side trend) 
 - breakaway gaps (volume is significantly high, point of breakout becomes support/resistance)
 - runaway gaps (in the middle of the trend, caused by increased interest in the stock, aka continuation/measuring gap) 
 - exhaustion gaps (occurs at the end of the move, volume spikes) 
 - island reversal gap (comes after exhaustion gap) 

Support and Resistance 
 - if price hits the support and resistance many times, it gives good opportunity 
 - Types: Static and Dynamic 
 - Static: Fibonaci levels, trend lines, round number and psychological levels are some examples 
 - Dynamic: Moving Averages and price channel  are examples 
 
Demand and Supply 
 - Support and Resistance Zones 
 - Level at which demand is enough to prevent the prices from declining further is known as support level 
 - Level at which sufficient supply is available to stop the prices from increasing is known as resistance level 
 - Support and Resistance levels are price zones 
 - If price movfe very quickly with large momentum, it is more likely to breach that level 
 
How to draw trend line and S/R 
 - Trend line is a very important tool of technical analysis 
 - Must not force a trend line to touch the points 
 - Set log scale setting
